Abstract
========

This PEP describes the Python Package Index (Warehouse) JSON API.
This API is accessed via HTTP GET requests.

Motivation
==========

This PEP aims to lock in the existing standard as a guarantee for consumers
(e.g., client applications like pip, pipenv and more). It also aims to help other
indexes (such as devpi, pypiserver and Artifactory) to implement the standard and be
assured of interoperability.

Definitions
===========

* **HTTP**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol
* **JSON API**: Canonical / historical name given to this API we are describing in this PEP
* **Metadata**: a set of data that describes and gives information about other data.
  In this case, *data* about an active Python Package on the Python Package Index.
* **Python Package**: Distributable archive of Python loadable source or binaries
* **TUF**: The Update Framework, as described in PEP 458


Use cases supported by the API
==============================

The *JSON API* is a read-only API to retrieve metadata of a Python Package.

Non-goals
=========

The following aspects will not be considered for the JSON API:

* Writeable endpoints: The JSON API is to remain read-only.

The following aspects will not be considered for this version of the JSON API:

* TUF integration and dependency resolution: This version of the JSON API is not
  protected by TUF, and so should not be used for dependency resolution. PyPI
  maintainers intend on providing a future download API that is TUF-protected
  within a few years.

Specification
=============

The JSON API is a HTTP GET based API. HTTP responses must be sent with the following content type:

::

   content-type: application/json

It is guaranteed to always have **only** strings as top-level key values.

Discovery
---------

The JSON API has a discovery endpoint at **/json**.
This endpoint will reply with the current API version.

Each API shall also have a GET discovery call at **/json/discovery/$endpoint_name**

Versioning
----------

The JSON API will use Semantic Versioning [3]_. This PEP currenly covers version **1.0.0**

Guaranteed response fields
--------------------------

Using the JSON Schema draft standard [1]_ here are the expected returned metadata fields from the
JSON API. The complete JSON has been broken down by top-level key values.

**JSON Top Level Keys**

::

  {
    "info": {},
    "last_serial": 0,
    "releases": {},
    "urls": {}
  }

**info**

::

  {
    "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
    "$id": "http://pypi.org/json_api:info.schema.json",
    "title": "info",
    "description": "Generic information pulled from Python Package configuration",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "author": {
         "description": "The name of the company of individual who created the package",
         "type": "string"
      },
      "author_email": {
         "description": "The company or individual's email address",
         "type": "string"
      }
    },
    "required": [ "author", "author_email" ]
  }

**last_serial**

::

  {
    "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
    "$id": "http://pypi.org/json_api:last_serial.schema.json",
    "title": "last_serial",
    "description": "Internal PyPI serial indicating last modification",
    "type": "int"
  }

**releases**

::

  {
    "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
    "$id": "http://pypi.org/json_api:releases.schema.json",
    "title": "releases",
    "description": "Per release (each version)",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "common_test": {
         "description": "The name of the company of individual who created the package",
         "type": "string"
      },
      "digests": {
         "description": "The company or individual's email address",
         "type": "object"
         "properties": {
            "md5": {
               "description": "The MD5 checksum of the release file",
               "type": "string"
            },
            "sha256": {
               "description": "The SHA256 checksum of the release file",
               "type": "string"
            }
         }
      }
    },
    "required": [ "author", "author_email" ]
  }

**urls**

Identical to releases, but for the latest release on the Python Package Index.


Deprecated response fields
--------------------------

The Python Package Index returns the following keys today, but they are not guaranteed
to be accurate, and are deprecated. Please feel free to leave these keys out of your
implementation.

**"info":**

* "downloads": This key and all children have been deprecated in favor of having clients
  use Google BigQuery data.

**"releases" / "urls":**

* "downloads": This key and all children have been deprecated in favor of having clients
  use Google BigQuery data.


Dealing with errors
-------------------

Client errors today are all handled via HTTP response codes. The following is returned:

* 404: When a projects does not exist
* 500: When an internal code logic or database error occurs

# TODO: Find out if there is anything else done? @cooperlees only knows of the errors above

Capitalization, case-sensitivity, and normalization
---------------------------------------------------

The JSON API normalizes package names as per PEP 503 [2]_.
